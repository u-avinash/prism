# How to Apply This Patch (Universal - Works for Git and Studio)
# ============================================================================
#
# OPTION 1: Anypoint Studio (GUI Method)
# ----------------------------------------
# 1. In Package Explorer, right-click on your project
# 2. Select "Team" → "Apply Patch..."
# 3. Choose "File" option
# 4. Browse to this patch file
# 5. Keep "Ignore leading path name segments" at 0 (default)
# 6. Click "Next" to preview changes
# 7. Review the changes in the diff view
# 8. Click "Finish" to apply
#
# OPTION 2: Git Command Line
# ----------------------------
# From the root of your repository, run:
#   git apply -p0 {patch_filename}
#
# Note: The -p0 flag tells git not to strip any path components
#
# OPTION 3: Standard Patch Command
# ----------------------------------
# From the root of your repository, run:
#   patch -p0 < {patch_filename}
#
# OPTION 4: Manual Application
# ------------------------------
# - Review the diff above
# - Apply changes to {error_file_path}
# - Test thoroughly before committing
